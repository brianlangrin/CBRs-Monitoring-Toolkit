# CBRs-Monitoring-Toolkit
My Python code for CBRs monitoring framework to systematically gather information on de-risking and conduct analytical work on identifying the drivers and impact. This code was written based on R code from IMF WP "Understanding Correspondent Banking Trends: A Monitoring Framework" by Dirk Jan Grolleman and David Jutras.
